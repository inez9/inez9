### Hi, I'm Inez! 👋

Electrical Engineering and Computer Science enthusiast sharing my journey and learning experiences across EE and CS.

🎓 Studying EECS at the University of California, Berkeley (2023-2027)

💡 Passionate about PCB Design for integrated systems and understanding the underlying physics of electronic components.

Currently immersed in the world of datasheets – where you go to learn everything about a component except how to use it in a sentence! 🤪

🛠️ Skills:

* Tools: Altium, SolidWorks, KiCad, Pytorch, SPICE
* Languages: Python, C, Java, C++, Verilog, MATLAB, SQL
* Microcontrollers/Embedded Systems: STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi
* Communication Protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, (a little Ethernet)

🚀 Projects & Experiences:

* **STAR Space Tech and Rocketry (UC Berkeley):** Designed and optimized PCB layouts for aerospace applications, conducted functional testing of avionics systems, and developed test fixtures for avionics integration. [cite: 2, 3, 4, 5]
* **Advanced RC Car Project:** Engineered a custom PCB for motor control, developed C-based firmware for an STM32 microcontroller, and implemented real-time feedback loops for autonomous navigation. [cite: 6, 7, 8, 9]
